            <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

                C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

                C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
            <p>The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.

            <ul>
                <li>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</li>
                <li>C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</li>
                <li>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows
                    code to be reused, lowering development costs.</li>
                <li>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                </li>
                <li>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</li>
                <li>As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa</li>
            </ul>

                Hello World
            </header>
            <p>To get started with writing open your favourite code editor and write your first "Hello World" C++ code:
            </p>
            <code>
                #include <iostream>
                    using namespace std;
                    
                    int main() {
                      cout << "Hello World!";
                      return 0;
                    }
            </code>
            <p>Save the code and hit build and run to watch it unfold.</p>

                Variables
            </header>
            <p>Variables are container for storing values.</p>
            <p>In C++, there are different <b>types</b> of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>int</b> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
                <li><b>double</b> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
                <li><b>char</b> - store single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single
                    quotes</li>
                <li><b>string</b> - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
                </li>
                <li><b>bool</b> - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header>
                if...else statement
            </header>
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause
                to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <p>conditon can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. If condition evaluates to true,
                statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
                statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
            <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
                follows:</p>
            <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
            } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                executed.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>
                while statement
            </header>
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                statement looks as follows:</p>
            <code>while (conditon) statement;</code>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.</p>
            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops
                and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Function_Declarations">
            <header>
                Function Declarations
            </header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                function keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>THe C++ statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {}. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <code>
                int square (int number) { return number * number; } 
            </code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says
                to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
